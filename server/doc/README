The documentation is included as a pdf in the Doc directory. 

It is called Personis.pdf and you should consult that now to get Personis
installed and working.

Should you want to alter it or have it in another form (html or epub)
you should use "sphinx", a python based documentation generation tool
used to maintain it.

Sphinx can make the documentation in many forms. To use the tool you
need sphinx and its dependencies installed, and latex if you want to
make the pdf version.

To make the various versions the command is:

	make html
	make latexpdf
	make epub

The generated versions are placed in the subdirectory "_build".
